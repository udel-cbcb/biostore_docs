# Getting Started with BioStore

There are a few steps you will need to complete before being able to access BioStore.

## Requesting Storage

First, you will need storage space.  Storage space on BioStore is allocated at the PI-level.  That means that only one person in a lab needs to request storage.  This is usually the PI, but other lab members may submit the request on behalf of the PI.  

The storage allocation request form can be found on iLab (further innstructions below) and acts as an application process for a lab (PI) level allocation.  When you fill out the form, be sure to include any members of the lab who will need to access BioStore in the "User List" table.  If your request is approved, those users will have accounts made for them.  

To access the BioStore storage allocation request form, first log into iLab.  If you do not have an iLab account, follow [these instructions](https://www.dbi.udel.edu/resources-and-facilities/ilab-instructions/ilab-ud-users) to create one.  Once logged in, click on the three horizontal bars at the top left of your screen and select "Core Facilities."  From this new screen, click on the core named "CBCB Bioinformatics Core."  You will then find the storage request form under the "Services" tab.

Be aware that storage allocations are limited availability and allocation awards will be given based on a number of factors, including demonstrated need, relevance of research to biomedical mission, and availablity of resources. Allocations will also need to be competitively renewed on an annual basis.

## Getting a Password

Your account on BioStore will be created when your resource allocation is approved.  To access this account, you will need a password.  

There are two options for passwords.  You may either (a) use a password of your own creation or (b) be assigned a password.  In either case, you will need to send an email help@biomiformatics.udel.edu; include "BioStore" in the subject line.   In the email, indicate which option you would like to use.  If requesting a password, you will receive an email with a link that you should click on to retrieve your password.  If you are using your own password, you will be sent a link to a webform where you can submit your password.  After doing so, follow the instructions provided by the website.

## Connecting to BioStore

Now that your lab has space allocated and you have an account on the server, you will be able to connect to BioStore! This can be done from your PC or from [Biomix](https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/core/hpc/), UD's high-performance computing cluster. 

Please click on your operating system you will be using to connect for specific instructions.  Note that while Biomix is a Linux cluster, there are separate instructions for Biomix and Linux PCs.
