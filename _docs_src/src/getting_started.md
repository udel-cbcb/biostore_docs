# Getting Started with BioStore

There are a few steps you will need to complete before being able to access BioStore.

## Requesting Storage

First, you will need storage space.  Storage space on BioStore is allocated at the PI-level.  That means that only one person in a lab needs to request storage.  This is usually the PI, but other lab members may submit the request on behalf of the PI.  

The storage allocation request form can be found on iLab (further innstructions below) and acts as an application process for a lab (PI) level allocation.  When you fill out the form, be sure to include any members of the lab who will need to access BioStore in the "User List" table.  If your request is approved, those users will have accounts made for them.  

To access the BioStore storage allocation request form, you will need an iLab account.  If you do not have an iLab account, follow [these instructions](https://www.dbi.udel.edu/resources-and-facilities/ilab-instructions/ilab-ud-users) to create one.  Once you have an account, you can click on [this link](https://udel.ilabsolutions.com/service_center/3725/?tab=services) to be taken to the "Service Requests" page for the CBCB Bioinformatics Core.  You can also navigate to this page by clicking on the three horizontal bars at the top left of your screen, selecting "Core Facilities," clicking on the core named "CBCB Bioinformatics Core," and then opening the "Services" tab.  The form you will need to fill out is the "Biomedical Data Storage Resource (BioStore) Allocation Request."  To initiate a new form, click on the "initiate request" button.

Be aware that storage allocations are limited availability and allocation awards will be given based on a number of factors, including demonstrated need, relevance of research to biomedical mission, and availablity of resources. Allocations will also need to be competitively renewed on an annual basis.

## Getting a Password

Your account on BioStore will be created when your resource allocation is approved.  To access this account, you will need a password.  

There are two options for passwords.  You may either (a) use a password of your own creation or (b) be assigned a password.  In either case, you will need to send an email help@biomiformatics.udel.edu; include "BioStore" in the subject line.   In the email, indicate which option you would like to use.  If requesting a password, you will receive an email with a link that you should click on to retrieve your password.  If you are using your own password, you will be sent a link to a webform where you can submit your password.  After doing so, follow the instructions provided by the website.

## Connecting to BioStore

Now that your lab has space allocated and you have an account on the server, you will be able to connect to BioStore! This can be done from your PC, no matter your operating system. 

Please click on your operating system you will be using to connect for specific instructions.  Note that while Biomix is a Linux cluster, there are separate instructions for Biomix and Linux PCs.

* [MacOS](./mac_connect.md)
* [Windows](./windows_connect.md)
* Coming Soon: Linux

BioStore can also be accessed from [Biomix](https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/core/hpc/), UD's high-performance computing cluster.  However, this access type will not be available for all users.  You will be notified upon receipt of your allocation request approval whether you have qualified for this use type.  Instructions for Biomix connection to BioStore are therefore available upon request only.

## Using BioStore

Now, you should be ready to use BioStore.  It's very easy to interact with BioStore, especially on a PC, but there are a few instructions to get you comfortable.  [Click here](./interact_with_biostore.md) for brief guidance on interacting with BioStore.
