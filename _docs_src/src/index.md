# BioStore Documentation

The Biomedical Data Storage Resource (BioStore) provides large data storage access needed by researchers in biomedical and allied fields to handle the increasingly large data requirements of certain technologies such as those hosted in our core facilities.  Storage allocations are limited availabiity and awarded at the PI-level.  Allocation awards are considered based upon factors including demonstrated need, relevance of research to biomedical mission, and availablity of resources.

Currently allocations to qualified users are provided free of charge due to generous support, however charges may be incurred for some related  services including advanced data archiving, backup, and custom data management or security needs.
