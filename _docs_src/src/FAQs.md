## Storage Allocation Requests

### How do I renew my allocation request?

You will receive an email reminder to renew your BioStore allocation 11 months after your application is approved.  After receiving this, you will need to resubmit the allocation request form on iLab.

## Connection Issues

### I am unable to connect from my home.

If you are not on UD's network, you will need to use the VPN to connect to BioStore.  You can download the VPN [here](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/anyconnect-vpn/).

## File Permissions

## Backups

### Is my data on BioStore backed up?

Currently, we do not perform backups of data on BioStore because of the robustness of the architecture.  We may implement a backup system in the future.

Uses compression, so we get more storage than you think (e.g. 10 TB of images to 7 TB)
