BioStore is a shared high-performance storage cluster. It consists of a Dell Isilon node cluster and 12 A300 storage nodes. How much data can be stored on BioStore? In total, BioStore offers almost 3 petabytes of storage. Storage Allocation Requests How do I request storage? To request storage, you will need to fill out the \"Biomedical Data Storage Resource (BioStore) Allocation Request\" form on iLab. To access the BioStore storage allocation request form, first log into iLab. If you do not have an iLab account, follow these instructions to create one. Once logged in, click on the three horizontal bars at the top left of your screen and select \"Core Facilities.\" From this new screen, click on the core named \"CBCB Bioinformatics Core.\" You will then find the storage request form under the \"Services\" tab. How do I create an iLab account? You can create an iLab account by following the instructions provided here . How do I renew my allocation request? You will receive an email reminder to renew your BioStore allocation 11 months after your application is approved. After receiving this, you will need to resubmit the allocation request form on iLab. Connection Issues I am unable to connect from my home. If you are not on UD's network, you will need to use the VPN to connect to BioStore. You can download the VPN here . Backups Is my data on BioStore backed up? The architecture underlying BioStore is very robust and has one node/two disk data redundancy. We may implement additional backup features in the future.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQs/#faqs","text":"","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQs/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"FAQs/#what-is-biostore-really","text":"BioStore is a shared high-performance storage cluster.

Requesting Storage First, you will need storage space. Storage space on BioStore is allocated at the PI-level. That means that only one person in a lab needs to request storage. This is usually the PI, but other lab members may submit the request on behalf of the PI. The storage allocation request form can be found on iLab (further innstructions below) and acts as an application process for a lab (PI) level allocation. When you fill out the form, be sure to include any members of the lab who will need to access BioStore in the \"User List\" table. If your request is approved, those users will have accounts made for them. To access the BioStore storage allocation request form, you will need an iLab account. If you do not have an iLab account, follow these instructions to create one. Once you have an account, you can click on this link to be taken to the \"Service Requests\" page for the CBCB Bioinformatics Core. You can also navigate to this page by clicking on the three horizontal bars at the top left of your screen, selecting \"Core Facilities,\" clicking on the core named \"CBCB Bioinformatics Core,\" and then opening the \"Services\" tab. The form you will need to fill out is the \"Biomedical Data Storage Resource (BioStore) Allocation Request.\" To initiate a new form, click on the \"initiate request\" button. Be aware that storage allocations are limited availability and allocation awards will be given based on a number of factors, including demonstrated need, relevance of research to biomedical mission, and availablity of resources. Allocations will also need to be competitively renewed on an annual basis. Getting a Password Your account on BioStore will be created when your resource allocation is approved. To access this account, you will need a password. There are two options for passwords. You may either (a) use a password of your own creation or (b) be assigned a password. In either case, you will need to send an email help@biomiformatics.udel.edu; include \"BioStore\" in the subject line. In the email, indicate which option you would like to use. If requesting a password, you will receive an email with a link that you should click on to retrieve your password. If you are using your own password, you will be sent a link to a webform where you can submit your password. After doing so, follow the instructions provided by the website. Connecting to BioStore Now that your lab has space allocated and you have an account on the server, you will be able to connect to BioStore! This can be done from your PC, no matter your operating system. Please click on your operating system you will be using to connect for specific instructions. Note that while Biomix is a Linux cluster, there are separate instructions for Biomix and Linux PCs. MacOS Windows Linux BioStore can also be accessed from Biomix , UD's high-performance computing cluster. However, this access type will not be available for all users. You will be notified upon receipt of your allocation request approval whether you have qualified for this use type. Instructions for Biomix connection to BioStore are therefore available upon request only.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started-with-biostore","text":"There are a few steps you will need to complete before being able to access BioStore.","title":"Getting Started with BioStore"},{"location":"getting_started/#requesting-storage","text":"First, you will need storage space.

If you are not on campus, this means that you must connect using the VPN . If you are a Linux user, you probably already know that there are several flavors of Linux. These instructions are for Ubuntu 20.04, but should be similar across Linux types. 1. Open up your file manager. 2. Navigate to 'Other Locations' on the left navigation pane. 3. Once in 'Other Locations', enter smb://biostore.dbi.udel.edu in the box at the bottom labeled \"Connect to Server.\" Then, hit connect. 4. A dialogue box will appear and tell you, \"Password required for biostore.dbi.udel.edu\". Your username will be the beginning of your udel email (the part before @udel.edu). The domain will be [username]@biostore.isilon , where [username] is the same username you entered in the previous box. Your password should have been set up in previous steps. After entering the username, domain, and password, hit \"Connect.\" 5. You should now be connected to BioStore! The file manager window will now display some of the directories on BioStore.

Make sure the option \"Registered User\" is selected. 7. You will now be able to use BioStore from either your file manager window or the command line. To access BioStore from the command line, you will need to find the smb mount. On our test device (Ubuntu 20.04), the location is ls /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share\\:server\\=biostore.dbi.udel.edu\\,share\\=your_directory/ , where your_directory is the name of the directory for your lab or group's storage (e.g., corefs).
